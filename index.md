- United Nations Environment Program
   - A scam
   - Too much science
   - Many grants
   - Directed to science, not action
- Overall United Nations
   - 60c to the dollar spent on staffing
   - 40c on proclaimed missions
   - X% efficiency of missions?
   - (100-X)% on target
   - You get this picture
- America First/Make America Great Again
   - Withdrawal from WHO
   - Zero funding for UN
   - Flows redirected to America
   - Layoffs in UN should target its American workers
   - But many more will be affected regardless
   - China emerging as greatest contributor (and will place more of its people in jobs of leadreship)
- Taken together (all the above)
   - Flows of resources
   - Centrally controlled (ie UN in New York or Geneva)
   - Locally insensitive to needs because 40c on the dollar is directed to problems
   - Perhaps similar issue with USAID
- How to summarize this from UKB-Canon?
   - Soil
   - Roots
   - Trunk
   - Branches
   - Canopy/Fruit
- Households, Firms, Governments, Alliances, Wars
   - Gradient/Flow problem
   - Adversarial, Cooperative, Transactional (latter two emerge from default adversarial)
   - How to view to 10 firms from this point of view? What unites them or distinguishes from the rest?
   - Should we use similar or different lens for governments and alliances like the UN?
   - What about NATO?
   - Very surprised that I'm getting aligned with MAGA on these matters!
